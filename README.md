# Time_Series_with_LSTM
The idea is to implement LSTM model on a simple time-series data-set

#### What is LSTM?
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDSs (intrusion detection systems).

#### What type of data-set are we looking into for this analysis?
The data-set is an airline passengers data-set. It compromises of two variables, Month and Passengers. It details about the number of passengers in a month.
